## Problem Statement

Most **specialty coffee shops** don’t have a loyalty or fidelity program, even though this would help in attracting more customers.  
The traditional **stamp card system** is inconvenient, since customers often forget it at home or lose it.  

Creating an **individual digital app** for each coffee shop isn’t practical, thje downsides being:

* it’s **expensive** and hard to maintain;
* there’s **no widely adopted platform** focused on specialty coffee shops;
* and existing “loyalty-only” apps bring **little added value** to the coffee shop.

---

## Solution / Value Proposition

**Tassea** aims to be a **shared platform** for specialty coffee shops that provides:

- **Core loyalty functionality** (customers collect points or stamps through recurring visits);  
- **Business analytics** with easy-to-read insights about customer behavior and trends;  
- **Real-time occupancy tracking**, updated hourly by coffee shops so users can decide where to go based on crowd levels;  
- **Feedback & discovery features**, allowing users to explore new shops and send suggestions directly to owners.

>  Tassea bridges the gap between customer engagement and valuable business data, creating a win-win ecosystem.

---

##  Customer Segment

- Primarily **Gen Z** and **millennials under 45 years old**, who frequently visit local coffee shops and use mobile apps daily.  
- However, the segment can vary depending on the **onboarding strategy** and **regional market**.

---

## Competition

| Competitor | Description | Limitation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Stampino** | Offers basic digital stamp cards. Users earn 1 stamp per visit and get a free coffee after 9 stamps. | Only one feature (loyalty cards), very limited coffee shop selection, and stamps don’t transfer between shops. |
