## Problem Statement

Most **specialty coffee shops** don’t have a loyalty or fidelity program, even though this would help in attracting more customers.  
The traditional **stamp card system** is inconvenient, since customers often forget it at home or lose it.  

Creating an **individual digital app** for each coffee shop isn’t practical — it’s expensive, difficult to maintain, and there’s no widely adopted platform focused on specialty coffee shops.  
Existing “loyalty-only” apps bring little added value to the business.

---

## Solution / Value Proposition

**Tassea** aims to be a **shared platform** for specialty coffee shops that provides:

- **Core loyalty functionality** (customers collect points or stamps through recurring visits);  
- **Business analytics** with insights about customer behavior and trends;  
- **Real-time occupancy tracking**, helping users decide where to go based on crowd levels;  
- **Feedback & discovery features**, allowing customers to explore new shops and interact directly with owners.

> Tassea bridges the gap between customer engagement and valuable business data, creating a win-win ecosystem.

---

## Customer Segment

Tassea primarily targets **Gen Z** and **Millennials under 45 years old**, who frequently visit local coffee shops and use mobile apps daily.  
The segment can expand depending on the onboarding strategy and regional market.

---

## Competition

| Competitor | Description | Limitation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Stampino** | Offers basic digital stamp cards. Users earn 1 stamp per visit and get a free coffee after 9 stamps. | Only one feature (loyalty cards), very limited coffee shop selection, and stamps don’t transfer between shops. |

---

## Tassea’s Advantage

Unlike competitors, **Tassea** goes beyond loyalty:

- Real-time occupancy information  
- Discovery page for exploring new coffee shops  
- Feedback and communication channel between customers and shop owners  
- Business analytics for shop owners  
- A cleaner, more engaging user experience  

These features add tangible value for both customers and businesses.

## Customer Discovery & Validation

???+ note "MUGSHOT – Coffess Shop Owner Interview"
    **1. Când vă gândiți la succesul vostru, cât de importantă este retenția clienților față de atragerea de clienți noi?**  
    Destul de importantă, deoarece clienții vechi aduc clienți noi, fie prin mijloacele de socializare, fie prin viu grai.

    **2. Ați încercat vreodată în trecut un sistem de a răsplăti clienții fideli?**  
    Da, fie le oferim reduceri consistente, fie le oferim ceva din partea casei.

    **3. Să presupunem că lansați o nouă băutură, schimbați meniul sau organizați un eveniment. Cum anunțați clienții despre asta în momentul de față?**  
    Promovăm evenimentele prin social media, în special Instagram, dar și prin promovare offline în cafenea.

    **4. Aveți vreo metodă acum prin care să puteți lua legătura direct cu cei mai fideli clienți ai voștri, separat de publicul larg de pe social media?**  
    Nu, din păcate, momentan nu.

    **5. Ați avut vreodată o situație în care ați fi vrut să știți mai multe despre tipologia clienților voștri (de ex. vârstă, frecvența vizitelor) pentru a lua o decizie de business? Puteți să-mi dați un exemplu?**  
    Nu, pentru că în momentul de față este destul de ușor să ne dăm seama cine ne trece pragul și cât de des vin, fiindcă ne aflăm între trei colegii/universități/licee. De obicei, oaspeții de dimineață sunt studenți și elevi, iar cei de seară sunt fie oameni din comunitate, persoane din acest cartier, fie persoane care au auzit de noi și vor să încerce băuturile, în special cocktailurile.

    **6. Gestionarea fluxului de clienți și a locurilor disponibile este vreodată o provocare?**  
    Nu, pentru că avem locuri oarecum limitate și știm cum să le organizăm în funcție de clienți.

    **7. Simțiți că pierdeți clienți în orele de vârf pentru că locația pare plină din exterior sau pentru că timpul de așteptare e prea mare?**  
    Nu, nu ne-am confruntat cu această problemă până acum.

Before developing the platform, the team conducted a detailed **Customer Discovery** process to confirm that the problem we aimed to solve was real and worth addressing.  
We approached this through **in-person interviews** and an **online survey** structured using the **Mom Test** framework, which focuses on real experiences and observable behavior rather than hypothetical scenarios.

Participants revealed that most specialty coffee shop visitors rarely or inconsistently use loyalty cards. Many said they **forgot or lost** their physical card, while shop owners confirmed they lack a simple, unified digital solution for customer retention.  
This confirmed that the problem wasn’t about disinterest but rather about **inconvenience and fragmentation** in existing systems.

The insights showed clear trends:  
- **67%** of respondents don’t use loyalty cards regularly.  
- **100%** expressed frustration after losing or forgetting a card.  
- **50%** abandoned a loyalty program due to complexity.  

Beyond loyalty, **83%** of participants said they had left a café because it was too crowded — a key validation for adding **real-time occupancy tracking**.  
They also shared that **Instagram** is their main source for discovering cafés, while **83%** delete retail app notifications immediately, suggesting that **pull-based engagement** works better than intrusive push notifications.

### Key Research Insights

| Question Focus | Main Finding | Validation Insight |
|----------------|---------------|--------------------|
| Why return to a café? | Quality and atmosphere matter most | Loyalty should support, not replace, experience |
| Use of loyalty cards | Low adoption (67% non-users) | Confirms usability gap |
| Forgotten card experiences | 100% frustration | Strong emotional pain point |
| Abandoning loyalty programs | 50% due to complexity | Need for simplicity |
| Leaving cafés due to crowds | 83% of users | Validates occupancy tracking feature |
| Discovering cafés/events | 67% via Instagram | Social-first marketing strategy |
| Notification behavior | 83% delete instantly | Avoid push; use pull UX |
| Curiosity about popular drinks | 83% interest | Opportunity for gamification and social proof |

---

### Product Impact

| Research Insight | Design Decision |
|------------------|----------------|
| Lost or forgotten cards | Introduced fully digital loyalty wallet |
| Complexity discourages users | One-tap stamp and reward collection |
| Overcrowding issues | Added real-time occupancy tracking |
| Notification fatigue | Replaced push notifications with in-app updates |
| Instagram discovery behavior | Built marketing around social-first channels |
| Curiosity for trends | Introduced “Top Drinks” leaderboard and discovery feed |

---

### From Discovery to Validation

These findings guided the development of **Tassea’s MVP**, focusing only on the most validated and high-value features.  
The problem has been verified through user behavior, emotional responses, and measurable patterns.  
The proposed solution aligns directly with what customers and café owners actually need: a digital, unified, simple, and data-driven loyalty experience.

Having confirmed the problem’s validity, the team is ready to move forward to the **Customer Validation stage**, where the goal is to test **real-world adoption** and **willingness to pay** through pilot programs with local coffee shops.  
Future testing will include A/B experiments with different reward structures, engagement metrics, and business conversion rates.

All evidence — including survey data, interview summaries, and the full analysis — has been archived and attached as proof of the discovery phase.

---

### Summary

Through thorough customer discovery and behavioral validation, **Tassea** confirmed that the lack of a unified, digital loyalty experience is a real and recurring problem in the specialty coffee market.  
The proposed solution provides measurable value for both customers and business owners, laying the foundation for a sustainable and scalable platform.  
Built on validated insights, **Tassea** stands as a smart, data-driven bridge between coffee lovers and their favorite cafés.
