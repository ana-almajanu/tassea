## Problem Statement

Most **specialty coffee shops** don‚Äôt have a loyalty or fidelity program, even though this would help in attracting more customers.  
The traditional **stamp card system** is inconvenient, since customers often forget it at home or lose it.  

Creating an **individual digital app** for each coffee shop isn‚Äôt practical, thje downsides being:

* it‚Äôs **expensive** and hard to maintain;
* there‚Äôs **no widely adopted platform** focused on specialty coffee shops;
* and existing ‚Äúloyalty-only‚Äù apps bring **little added value** to the coffee shop.

---

## Solution / Value Proposition

**Tassea** aims to be a **shared platform** for specialty coffee shops that provides:

- **Core loyalty functionality** (customers collect points or stamps through recurring visits);  
- **Business analytics** with easy-to-read insights about customer behavior and trends;  
- **Real-time occupancy tracking**, updated hourly by coffee shops so users can decide where to go based on crowd levels;  
- **Feedback & discovery features**, allowing users to explore new shops and send suggestions directly to owners.

>  Tassea bridges the gap between customer engagement and valuable business data, creating a win-win ecosystem.

---

##  Customer Segment

- Primarily **Gen Z** and **millennials under 45 years old**, who frequently visit local coffee shops and use mobile apps daily.  
- However, the segment can vary depending on the **onboarding strategy** and **regional market**.

---

## Competition

| Competitor | Description | Limitation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Stampino** | Offers basic digital stamp cards. Users earn 1 stamp per visit and get a free coffee after 9 stamps. | Only one feature (loyalty cards), very limited coffee shop selection, and stamps don‚Äôt transfer between shops. |

# üß≠ Customer Discovery & Validation Process

## 1. How We Identified the Problem

Most **specialty coffee shops** still use physical stamp cards for loyalty.  
Customers often **forget** or **lose** them, leading to frustration and missed rewards, while coffee shops lose engagement data and repeat customers.

Through our **Customer Discovery process** and a **Mom Test‚Äìbased survey**, we confirmed that:

- ‚òï **67%** of respondents do not use loyalty cards consistently.  
- üí≥ **100%** experienced frustration after losing or forgetting a card.  
- ‚öôÔ∏è **50%** abandoned a loyalty system because it was too complex.  

These insights validated that **the problem is real and recurring** ‚Äî loyalty engagement is broken not because of disinterest, but due to poor usability and lack of centralization.

---

## 2. Proposed Solution

To solve these pain points, we designed **Tassea**, a **shared digital loyalty platform** for specialty coffee shops.

Tassea provides:
- A **cross-caf√© digital loyalty system** ‚Äî no physical cards required  
- **Real-time occupancy data** to help customers avoid crowded caf√©s  
- **Business analytics dashboards** for shop owners  
- **Feedback and discovery tools** to strengthen customer engagement  

---

## 3. Customer Discovery Plan

We followed the **Customer Discovery process** and **Mom Test methodology**, focusing on real experiences rather than opinions:

1. Define hypotheses about key problems (loyalty inconvenience, poor analytics, crowding).  
2. Identify and segment users (18‚Äì45 y/o coffee lovers and shop owners).  
3. Conduct interviews and surveys focused on *past behavior*.  
4. Validate pain intensity before testing the solution.  
5. Refine the MVP based on findings.  

---

## 4. Process & Findings

### üéØ Target Segments
- **Primary:** Gen Z & Millennials (18‚Äì45), frequent visitors of specialty caf√©s.  
- **Secondary:** Coffee shop owners and managers open to digital transformation.

### üìã Research Methods
- Face-to-face interviews with caf√© customers  
- Online survey distributed via Instagram coffee communities  
- Follow-up questionnaires for quantifiable insights  

### üß© Methodology
A **13-question survey** built using *The Mom Test* framework to ensure unbiased responses (focused on *past behavior* and *real pain*).

---

### üìä Key Questions & Insights

| # | Question (Shortened) | Key Finding | Validation Purpose |
|---|----------------------|--------------|--------------------|
| 1 | Why return to a caf√©? | 83% said quality, 33% price/location | Loyalty is secondary to experience |
| 2 | Use loyalty cards? | 67% rarely/never | Adoption gap exists |
| 3 | Forgot your card? | 100% frustration | Emotional pain validated |
| 4 | Quit a loyalty system? | 50% yes ‚Äì too complicated | Simplicity is crucial |
| 5 | Reward to switch caf√©s? | Free coffee/discount | Hypothetical ‚Äì validate later |
| 6 | Left due to crowding? | 83% yes | Real-time occupancy valuable |
| 7 | How long wait before leaving? | 10 min average | Defines queue visibility need |
| 8 | Top 2 factors when working in caf√©? | Power outlets, quiet | Confirms ‚Äúwork spot‚Äù insight |
| 9 | How decide to enter? | Based on crowd visibility | Validates live occupancy need |
| 10 | How discover new caf√©s/events? | 67% Instagram | Validates social-first marketing |
| 11 | How react to notifications? | 83% delete instantly | Avoid push; use pull UX |
| 12 | What info want from caf√©s? | Offers, new products | Sets content focus |
| 13 | Curious about popular drinks? | 83% yes | Validates gamification idea |

**‚úÖ 9/13 questions passed** the full Mom Test (real behavior focus).  
**‚ö†Ô∏è 4 questions** were hypothetical and require validation during MVP testing.

## 5. Impact on Product Development

| Crowding drives abandonment | Added real-time occupancy tracking |

## 6. Readiness for Customer Validation

‚úÖ **We are ready to move to the Customer Validation stage.**

### Supporting Arguments:
