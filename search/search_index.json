We approached this through in-person interviews and an online survey structured using the Mom Test framework, which focuses on real experiences and observable behavior rather than hypothetical scenarios.</p> <p>Participants revealed that most specialty coffee shop visitors rarely or inconsistently use loyalty cards. Many said they forgot or lost their physical card, while shop owners confirmed they lack a simple, unified digital solution for customer retention. This confirmed that the problem wasn\u2019t about disinterest but rather about inconvenience and fragmentation in existing systems.</p> <p>The insights showed clear trends: - 67% of respondents don\u2019t use loyalty cards regularly. - 100% expressed frustration after losing or forgetting a card. - 50% abandoned a loyalty program due to complexity.  </p> <p>Beyond loyalty, 83% of participants said they had left a caf\u00e9 because it was too crowded \u2014 a key validation for adding real-time occupancy tracking.
